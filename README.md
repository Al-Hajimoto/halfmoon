> Front-end framework with a built-in dark mode, designed for rapidly building beautiful dashboards and product pages.

- **Designed specifically for building dashboards**—This means that a lot of importance is placed on components such as forms, navbars, sidebars, dropdowns, toasts, shortcuts, etc.
- **Buit-in dark mode**—Now all of your websites will automatically come with a dark mode.
- **Optional JS library**—Many of the components found in Halfmoon are built to work without JavaScript. However, the framework still comes with a powerful JavaScript library  with no extra dependencies, such as jQuery.
- **Bootstrap like classes**—The class names should be instantly familiar to anyone who has used Bootstrap.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**—Fully supports almost all the browsers under the sun, including really old ones like Internet Explorer 11.
