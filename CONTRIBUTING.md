# Contributing to Halfmoon

Please read this short document if you want to contribute to Halfmoon.

## Our goal

Before getting to the issues and pull requests, it is important to understand what the framework is trying to do.

Halfmoon's stated goal is really simple - create a frontend framework that is customizable, has a built-in dark mode, and is great for building tools and dashboards. However, there are other goals that are more implicit:

- Every thing has to be **super functional and snappy**. Ideally that means no performance issues, and just consistently good execution. 
- Every thing has to **look good** as well, and have a **single consistent style**.

It's not about you or me, it's about building a **really good (looking) framework that works really well**, and that should always be the top priority.

## Issues

Please keep the following things in mind when raising issues:

- Feature requests are welcome. However, please make sure that the feature you are requesting falls under the scope of the project.
-  **Do not** post personal support questions as issues. For those, use this [tag in Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/halfmoon).
- When raising an issue, please be as thorough as possible. For possible bugs, reproducible code is always a great sign.

## Pull requests

Please keep the following things in mind before creating pull requests:

- **Please ask first**. The best way to do this is through email: [hey.halfmoon@gmail.com](mailto:hey.halfmoon@gmail.com). At this stage, the project really needs to be nurtured with strong leadership, so that it becomes something special. I would love to have a proper chat and really discuss how you can contribute to the project in a meaningful way. 
- Goes without saying that the pull request should remain within the scope of the project. Keeping the focus on the goals stated above is the only way forward.
